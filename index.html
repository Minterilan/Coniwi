                <h4>AI-Powered Personalized Outreach</h4>
                <p>Instead of sending generic cold emails, we use AI to deeply analyze each target company — their website, messaging, and product focus. From that insight, we craft outreach that feels <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #2980b9;">relevant and timely</span>, so your message stands out.</p>
                <h5>What this means for you:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Company-level insights</strong> – scanning websites for positioning and needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tailored messaging</strong> – every email reflects that company’s reality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Higher response rates</strong> – because prospects feel you’ve done the homework.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficient scaling</strong> – AI enables personalization at scale without losing relevance.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>End result:</strong> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #2980b9;">More conversations and opportunities</span> with the right companies.</p>

                            <p>Looking deeper into Gizmo’s Amazon setup, the missed revenue isn’t from product quality, it’s from campaign execution:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>High-intent organic keywords (the ones actually driving purchases) aren’t being targeted for ranking defense — which lets competitors win.</li>
                                <li>Sponsored Brand (SB) campaigns are underutilized — meaning brand awareness is capped, even though SB is the cheapest way to expand share.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Most agencies blast broad keywords and hope for conversions. Instead, we start by locking down organic conversion keywords, then scale with SB to lift awareness — that’s how we get predictable uplifts without burning margin.</p>
                            <p>Should I map out how this could look specifically for Gizmo?</p>

                        <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Why we don’t use Amazon “tools”</p>
                        <div class="email-body">
                            <p>Hi Hakan,</p>
                            <p>I also saw your repost on how “Amazon tools are garbage.” Totally agree. </p>
                            <p>To clarify — we don’t rely on the Amazon tools you called “garbage.” Instead, we run a lean tech stack + SOP sheets that show exactly how we structure campaigns for ranking, keyword defense, and awareness lift.</p>
                            <p>If you’d like, I can send over:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Why we deliberately don’t use certain Amazon tools,</li>
                                <li>The workflows we run instead (our SOP sheet),</li>
                                <li>And how we uncover the ad strategies of Old Spice and your other competitors.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>No strings attached — just so you can see our thinking. Would that be useful for you?</p>

            <h2>Why Each Line is Written This Way & Core Logic</h2>
            <h3>Core Logic Across the Sequence</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Role titles, his repost, and Gizmo product → prove homework.</li>
                <li><strong>Specificity:</strong> Competitor names + +25% revenue figure → believable, not fluffy.</li>
                <li><strong>Pattern-interrupt subjects:</strong> Short, curiosity-driven, not generic (“Scaling Gizmo vs Rexona”).</li>
                <li><strong>Risk reversal:</strong> “We don’t get paid…” removes CEO’s biggest objection.</li>
                <li><strong>Scannability:</strong> 2–3 bullets per email → easy for exec eyes.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Email 1</h4>
            <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Scaling Gizmo vs Rexona & Old Spice</p>
            <p><strong>Logic:</strong> Gizmo directly against known competitors → creates brutal curiosity.</p>
            <h5>Body highlights:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Role reference (“President + CEO”) → respect + credibility + I studied you</li>
                <li>“+25% revenue” → specific upside, feels real.</li>
                <li>Hard CTA: Worth chatting > Definitely it's for this guarantee “We don’t get paid if we can’t hit target” → risk-free, margin-safe.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Email 2</h4>
            <p><strong>Subject:</strong> The 2 gaps holding Gizmo back on Amazon</p>
            <p><strong>Logic:</strong> Numbered subject = scannable; “holding back” = loss aversion.</p>
            <h5>Body highlights:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Pain 1: Not defending organic conversion keywords.</li>
                <li>Pain 2: Underusing Sponsored Brands for awareness.</li>
                <li>Bridge: Contrast “agencies spray keywords” vs “we structure defense first.”</li>
                <li>CTA: “Should I map out how this looks for Gizmo?” → light, easy yes. Send an explanatory Loom carrying a meeting CTA and dial after the Loom view.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Email 3</h4>
            <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Why we don’t use Amazon ‘tools’</p>
            <p><strong>Logic:</strong> Mirrors his language, sets curiosity (“why?”).</p>
            <h5>Body highlights:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Align: “We don’t use the tools you dislike.”</li>
                <li>Differentiation: Lean tech stack + SOP sheets.</li>
                <li>Offer: Send SOP + explain how it applies to Gizmo.</li>
                <li>Soft CTA: “Would that be useful?” → no pressure, but opens door. Send an SOP carrying a meeting link > dial/email 2-3 days later. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Our Emails Don't Land in Spam</h2>
            <p>Email deliverability is crucial for successful outreach. We employ several key strategies and technologies to ensure your emails reach the inbox and maintain a strong sender reputation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Email Warm-up:</strong> New email accounts are gradually "warmed up" by sending a low volume of emails initially and slowly increasing it over time. This process builds trust with email service providers, signaling that the emails are legitimate and not spam.</li>
                <li><strong>Email Verification:</strong> Before sending, all email addresses are meticulously verified using tools like FullEnrich. This ensures that we are sending emails to valid and active inboxes, drastically reducing bounce rates and protecting your sender reputation. Sending to invalid addresses can severely damage your domain's reputation and lead to emails being marked as spam.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Personalization (Custom AI):</strong> Especially in our advanced offer, we leverage AI-powered personalization through platforms like and our custom AI for the Russia market. Sending highly personalized and relevant emails significantly increases engagement and reduces the likelihood of being flagged as spam, as recipients are more likely to open and interact with content tailored to them.</li>
                <li><strong>Reputation Management:</strong> Our email sending platforms like Instantly are configured to manage sending volume and frequency effectively across multiple accounts and domains. This distributed sending strategy, combined with continuous monitoring, helps maintain a healthy sender score.</li>
                <li><strong>USA IP Usage:</strong> We utilize USA-based IP addresses for sending emails. This practice enhances deliverability and reduces the likelihood of emails being flagged as spam, as USA IPs are generally considered more trustworthy by email service providers.</li>
                <li><strong>Highly Targeted Lead Lists & Content Alignment:</strong> Our lead lists are meticulously curated to ensure they consist of highly targeted prospects whose profiles align perfectly with the content of our emails (Ideal Customer Profile - ICP alignment). This relevance drastically increases engagement rates and signals to email providers that our communications are valuable, not spam.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By combining these strategies, we ensure high deliverability rates, allowing your messages to consistently reach your target audience's inboxes.</p>
